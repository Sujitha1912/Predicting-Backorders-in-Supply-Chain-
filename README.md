# Predicting Backorders in the Bachoredr Supply Chain

Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict backorders in the Bachoredr supply chain, optimizing inventory management, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction.

### Skills:
Data analysis (Python)
Machine learning (Random Forest)
Feature engineering
Model evaluation
Supply chain analysis

### Activities:

### Data exploration and preprocessing:
Analyzed historical order data (e.g., order date, product, quantity), inventory levels, and supplier information.
Cleaned, transformed, and prepared data for machine learning.

### Feature engineering:
Created new features based on order history, product characteristics, supplier performance, and demand trends.
Used domain knowledge to identify relevant features for backorder prediction.

### Model development and evaluation:
Implemented a Random Forest model achieving 89% precision and 46% recall in identifying backorder-prone orders.
Compared the Random Forest model with other algorithms for better understanding.

### Analysis and insights:
Identified key factors contributing to backorders through model analysis and feature engineering (mention specific findings).
Analyzed the impact of backorders on supply chain efficiency and customer satisfaction.
